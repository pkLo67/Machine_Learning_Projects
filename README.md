# Machine_Learning_Projects

This repository includes python codes for machine learning projects I completed during joining the IBM professional certification program for machine learning (https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-machine-learning).

These python-based machine learning projects cover the following topics:
* Supervised Machine Learning - Regression
* Supervised Machine Learning - Classification
* Unsupervised Machine Learning
* Deep Learning (CNN, RNN and LSTM)
* Time Series forecasting using deep learning
